[MixMatch: A Holistic Approach to Semi-Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02249) paper implemented for any dataset using Fastai v2 framework.
Some ideas taken from [YU1ut repository](https://github.com/YU1ut/MixMatch-pytorch) (Pytorch implementation for CIFAR10) and others from [noachr repository](https://github.com/noachr/MixMatch-fastai) (only compatible with Fastai v1)
